Seven visuals were created using Tableau using data regarding the total number of trips, types of users, and trip duration. Using this data we are able to identify key information such as what times bikes are used the most, how bike usage is broken down by gender, and which days are the most popular for usage. 

Based on the data displayed in our visuals, we can determine several key factors of the bikesharing industry. 

* Majority of trips are approximately 30 minutes long, with a large decline around the one hour mark. 
* Majority of users identify as male
* Weekdays see higher volume of bike usage in the mid afternoon, starting at approxiamtely 4PM, based on the data from the heatmap.
* There are approximately 1,530,272 male users, with another 500,000 or so female members based on the data displayed in the pie chart.  
* Based on the heatmap, we can see that thursday evening is the most active time for bike usage.
* Based on the heatmap we can see that wednesday does not have the same increase in usage after 5 PM that other days of the week see. 

## Summary

Based on the visualizations we created in Tableau, we can determine that the biking market is likely to be relatively successful with new locations in Des Moines. Based on the data presented, we can assume that the market would be most successful in the mornings and afternoons with primarily males using bikes for activities such as work commuting on week days. If I were to use additional visualizations, I would add data regarding the usage of bikes throughout different months to identify changes as weather cools down. I would also gather data on the population of Des Moines and determine if the industry would be successful based on their gender distribution.
